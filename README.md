# Remote_Robotic_Arm_Teleoperation_Interface
The project is about to achieve remote control of the robotic arm through a teleoperation interface, users can make operations such as click or drag using their mouse upon this interface to specify a grasp pose of the robotic arm and then control it.
To achieve the control, user only have to click the desire point in generated window, and algorithm could automatic caculate a target gripper pose list including about 30 different poses. After determining which gripper pose to choose, user can call service to activate the robotic arm moving to expect position.
